        <p id = "p1">Hello, I am a second year student at the Illinois Institute of Technology majoring in Information Technology and Managment. Why? Computers have always interested me since the first time I used one. Security and Software Desgin are two of the most interesting forks from this major in my opinion. The first time I used a computer is also around the time I moved to the United States.</p>

That was a big change from tractors and animals to a city with thousands of people, from a school where I had one other classmate to a school with many. Going to school I started to favor math becasue it logical and just made sense. Math somewhat relates to computers which also a pro. Other intrests include: </p>
