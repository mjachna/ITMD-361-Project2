        <h2>Why games?</h2>
        <p class = "gpara">The first consol I ever played was a Sega Dreamcast. It intaduced me to gaming and it's been something that kept my attention and intrest ever since. Playing video games feels like creating your own story rather then watching it play out. It's also extremly fun!</p>
